# Memory Card Game

[**Made as a project for The Odin Project curriculum.**](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/memory-card)

A Minecraft-themed memory game. Keep picking cards, but if you pick the same one twice, you lose! Plus, the order of cards are shuffled every time you pick.

This project was done to practice using hooks and state in React.

This website has responsive design, so for smaller screen sizes the website is still easy to read and interact with. The website will also change colors based on your device's dark mode setting.
